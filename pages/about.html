            Tim started showing Charolais cattle nationally at the age of 7. This involved becoming an active member of the 
            National Charolais association, and serving on the Iowa Junior Charolais association. After traveling on the Charolais
            circuit, Tim then transitioned to the Iowa Junior Angus Association, serving as the treasurer, secretary, vice president
            , and President for numerous years in each position. Tim's favorite postion obtained was the Iowa candidate for the 
            National Junior Angus Association Board of Directors. Tim's candidacy was at the Junior Nationals in 2015, held in Grand 
            Island, Nebraska. Tim was elected on to the Board of Directors this year, serving for two years until his term ended in 
            2017, where Junior Nationals were held in his home state of Iowa, also coincidentally the location of his first Angus 
            Nationals in 2008.
